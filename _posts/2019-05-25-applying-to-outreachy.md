[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/) provides 3 month long _paid_, *remote* internships to underrepresented groups in *Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)*.

All of those are pretty attractive things all by themselves, but more importantly, Outreachy is oriented to beginners interested in FOSS but have made only tentative steps.

1. All projects are listed not just by technologies involved, but also expectations of the degree of expertise in those that is needed and their importance. Typically, a project requirement may look like:

        1. Python, Required, Must have done projects
        2. Git, Good to know, Must have used
        3. CI/CD, Good to know, Read about     

2. The application process is oriented around early involvement in the community and submitting contributions throughout it. It's an involved process. Submissions for every project are a different process, their difficulty dependent on the community.

I heard about Outreachy late in its December round in 2018, but I didn't qualify the initial application as I was free from university commitments only 20 days during the internship period. This is a *full time* internship: I'm definitely working upwards of 40 hours a week. (I don't really want to stop.)

#### Picking a Project

Based on previous years projects, you can make a guess of which communities will be involved. Organisations vary, but you can talk to interns and check in on IRC.
> sidenote: there are such things as IRC bouncers that keep logs for you. I only found out on the first day of the internship when I was gifted a setup with one by my mentor

On project release day, spend time picking a project (maybe two at most) and begin contributing. The requirements are very useful. Often popular communities with low hanging fruit will have issues claimed very early. Projects are added throughout the period, so save your second choice for later and pay attention to the mailing list.

It's really important to pick a project you find valuable, talk to mentors and take advantage of the application period to figure out if you're a good fit for the project.

#### Following up on contributions
Open Source Development is terrifyingly public and when a reviewer shows you your mistakes it can seem like they're monuments to your sins that will be memorialised forever.
 >Ways to avoid memorialisation: have a very common name, submit new patches and plan on contributing for the rest of your life to drown them, consider moving to the EU to invoke right to forget laws.

First, on avoiding mistakes. Scour Coding Style guidelines, Submit A Patch guides and other developer documentation. Find your projects checkpatch.pl script or atleast set the options into your IDE. If your project submits patches by mail, I recommend reading [this](https://kernelnewbies.org/PatchPhilosophy). It will save you the grief.

Second, people will forgive you. They do want you to learn after all. Keep contributing.

Good luck!
